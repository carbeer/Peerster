 abstract = {Proofs of storage (PoS) are interactive protocols allowing a client to verify that a server faithfully stores a file. Previous work has shown that proofs of storage can be constructed from any homomorphic linear authenticator~(HLA). The latter, roughly speaking, are signature/message authentication schemes where `tags' on multiple messages can be homomorphically combined to yield a `tag' on any linear combination of these messages.},

@incollection{Clarke.2001,
 abstract = {We describe Freenet, an adaptive peer-to-peer network application that permits the publication, replication, and retrieval of data while protecting the anonymity of both authors and readers. Freenet operates as a network of identical nodes that collectively pool their storage space to store data files and cooperate to route requests to the most likely physical location of data. No broadcast search or centralized location index is employed. Files are referred to in a location-independent manner, and are dynamically replicated in locations near requestors and deleted from locations where there is no interest. It is infeasible to discover the true origin or destination of a file passing through the network, and dificult for a node operator to determine or be held responsible for the actual physical contents of her own node.},

@inproceedings{Weatherspoon.2002,
 abstract = {Peer-to-peer systems are positioned to take advantage of gains in network bandwidth, storage capacity, and computational resources to provide long-term durable storage infrastructures. In this paper, we quantitatively compare building a distributed storage infrastructure that is self-repairing and resilient to faults using either a replicated system or an erasure-resilient system. We show that systems employing erasure codes have mean time to failures many orders of magnitude higher than replicated systems with similar storage and bandwidth requirements. More importantly, erasure-resilient systems use an order of magnitude less bandwidth and storage to provide similar system durability as replicated systems.},
